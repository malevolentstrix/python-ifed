    "### Describe what each of the following means\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Production\n",
    "\n",
    "Production means anything that you need to work reliably, and consistently.\n",
    "Whether is a build script, or a public facing web server.\n",
    "When others rely on your code, particularly folks who may not understand it (i.e. even \"smart\" developers but perhaps not in your group, but using a library you wrote), that code is production code.\n",
    "software running on production servers to handle live users and data of the intended audience. Note, this is different from production quality code, which describes code that meets expectations in reliability, efficiency, etc., for production. Ideally, all code in production meets these expectations, but this is not always the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clean \n",
    "\n",
    "Readable, simple, and concise. A characteristic of production quality code that is crucial for collaboration and maintainability in software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modular\n",
    "\n",
    "Logically broken up into functions and modules. Also an important characteristic of production quality code that makes your code more organized, efficient, and reusable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Module\n",
    "\n",
    "A file. Modules allow code to be reused by encapsulating them into files that can be imported into other files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Refactoring code\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of restructuring existing computer code—changing the factoring—without changing its external behavior. Refactoring is intended to improve the design, structure, and/or implementation of the software (its non-functional attributes), while preserving its functionality. Potential advantages of refactoring may include improved code readability and reduced complexity; these can improve the source code's maintainability and create a simpler, cleaner, or more expressive internal architecture or object model to improve extensibility. Another potential goal for refactoring is improved performance; software engineers face an ongoing challenge to write programs that perform faster or use less memory.\n"
